The system should run in BOT mode (random BOT moves for player X & O) to print on the screen all the 
player's moves (with a 2 seconds timeout between each round) until someone won or the game ends with 
a draw

Pomodoro 1:

[x] create function for creating empty board (9 empty ' ')
    [x] test - check expected board and length of the list 
[x] create function  choose_starting_player() for randomly chosen first player (X or O)
    [x] test for function
